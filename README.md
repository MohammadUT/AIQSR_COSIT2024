This work introduced a conceptual relational model that combines explicit spatial and temporal calculi with functional roles. The model was used to instruct a GPT3.5 model, addressing two key challenges in the GeoQA domain: enhancing the interpretation of spatio-temporal relations in questions and generating a more representative and extensive corpus of such questions. The paper concludes by emphasizing the effectiveness of explicitly instructing generative AI models with conceptual models, particularly in tasks involving complex spatial and temporal relationships. This approach significantly improves the model's performance in labeling and generating geospatial questions, highlighting the potential for further research and application in the field of GeoQA.
